Copyright (C) 2012-2023 Giuseppe Cal√† <gcala@mailbox.org>

Pacman Log viewer is a tool used to inspect pacman log file, in particular
it lists installed, removed, upgraded, downgraded and reinstalled packages
allowing you to filter by package name and/or date.

A common use case is after a problematic update when many files are
involved and we do not much care about applied changes.

This utility works only in Archlinux and derivative and requires the Qt5 or
above toolkit.
